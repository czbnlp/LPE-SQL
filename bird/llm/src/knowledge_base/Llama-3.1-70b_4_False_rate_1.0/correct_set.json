The `budget` table contains the budgeted categories and amounts, while the `event` table contains the event names.\n\n3. **Establish the relationship between tables**: The `budget` table is linked to the `event` table through the `link_to_event` foreign key, which references the `event_id` primary key in the `event` table.\n\n4. **Filter the data**: To focus on the 'April Speaker' event, I added a `WHERE` clause to filter the data based on the `event_name` column in the `event` table.\n\n5. **Group the data**: To calculate the total amount budgeted for each category, I used the `GROUP BY` clause to group the data by the `category` column in the `budget` table.\n\n6. **Calculate the total amount budgeted**: To calculate the total amount budgeted for each category, I used the `SUM` aggregation function on the `amount` column in the `budget` table.\n\n7. **Sort the results**: To list the budgeted categories in ascending order based on their amount budgeted, I used the `ORDER BY` clause with the `ASC` keyword.\n\nBy following these steps, I generated the SQL query that solves the problem:\n\n```sql\nSELECT T1.category, SUM(T1.amount) \nFROM budget AS T1 \nINNER JOIN event AS T2 \nON T1.link_to_event = T2.event_id \nWHERE T2.event_name = 'April Speaker' \nGROUP BY T1.category \nORDER BY SUM(T1.amount) ASC\n```",

This can be done by querying the `races` table with the conditions `name = 'Bahrain Grand Prix'` and `year = 2007`.\n\n4. **Identify drivers who did not finish**: In the `results` table, drivers who did not finish the race will have a `NULL` value in the `time` column.

The `eye_colour_id` column in the `superhero` table links to the `id` column in the `colour` table.\n\n2. **Determine the condition for blue eyes**: Blue eyes are represented by the color 'Blue' in the `colour` table, which has an `id` of 7. However, since we're joining the tables, we can directly compare the `colour` column to 'Blue'.\n\n3. **Use a JOIN to combine the tables**: An INNER JOIN is used to combine the `superhero` and `colour` tables based on the `eye_colour_id` and `id` columns.\n\n4. **Use a CASE statement to count superheroes with blue eyes**: A CASE statement is used to count the number of superheroes with blue eyes. If the `colour` is 'Blue', then the CASE statement returns 1, otherwise it returns 0.
