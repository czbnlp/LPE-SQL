If true, the corresponding `spent` amount is included in the sum; otherwise, it is ignored (by adding 0).\n\n4. **Calculate the total spent amount for each year**: I used the `SUM` function to calculate the total spent amount for each year.\n\n5. **Calculate the difference between the two years**: Finally, I subtracted the total spent amount for 2020 from the total spent amount for 2019 to get the desired difference.\n\nThe resulting SQL query effectively calculates the difference in total spent amounts between 2019 and 2020 by joining the `event` and `budget` tables, extracting the year from the `event_date` column, and using conditional summing to filter and aggregate the data.",

However, this table doesn't contain the player's name, so we also need to join the `Player` table to link the player's API ID with their name.\n\n3. **Specify the join condition**: The `Player_Attributes` table has a foreign key `player_api_id` that references the `player_api_id` in the `Player` table.

The `COUNT` function then counts the non-`NULL` values.\n\n5. **Calculate the percentage**: We divide the count of chlorine atoms by the total count of carcinogenic molecules and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.
