The query was only considering individual rows in the `yearmonth` table, rather than aggregating the consumption for each customer.\n\nTo fix this, I added a `GROUP BY` clause to group the results by customer ID, and a `SUM` aggregation function to calculate the total consumption for each customer. This ensures that the query returns the customer with the least total consumption in 2012.\n\nHowever, upon further review, I realized that the `BETWEEN` clause was not the most accurate way to filter the dates, as it would include dates outside of 2012 if they were present in the data. A more precise approach is to use the `SUBSTR` function to extract the year from the `Date` column and compare it to '2012'.\n\n**Tip to Avoid Similar Mistakes:**\n\nWhen working with date columns, consider using more precise methods to filter dates, such as extracting the year or month using functions like `SUBSTR` or `DATE_FORMAT`, rather than relying on `BETWEEN` clauses.
