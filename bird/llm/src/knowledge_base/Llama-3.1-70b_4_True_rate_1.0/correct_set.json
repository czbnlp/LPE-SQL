The `expense` table contains the cost, the `budget` table links expenses to events, and the `event` table contains the event names.\n\n2. **Determine the joins**: To link the `expense` table to the `event` table, I needed to join the `expense` table to the `budget` table on the `link_to_budget` column, and then join the `budget` table to the `event` table on the `link_to_event` column.\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost for the 'Yearly Kickoff' event**: I used a `CASE` statement within the `SUM` function to only sum the costs where the event name is 'Yearly Kickoff'.\n\n4. **Calculate the total cost for all events**: I used the `SUM` function to calculate the total cost for all events.\n\n5. **Calculate the percentage**: I divided the total cost for the 'Yearly Kickoff' event by the total cost for all events and multiplied by 100 to get the percentage.\n\n6. **Cast the result to a REAL**: To ensure a decimal result, I cast the result of the division to a REAL.\n\nThe resulting SQL query is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN T4.event_name = 'Yearly Kickoff' THEN T3.cost ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / SUM(T3.cost) \nFROM expense AS T1 \nINNER JOIN budget AS T2 ON T1.link_to_budget = T2.budget_id \nINNER JOIN event AS T3 ON T2.link_to_event = T3.event_id\n```\n\nHowever, there seems to be a mistake in the query. The `expense` table does not have a `cost` column, it has a `cost` column in the `expense` table but it is referenced by `T1` not `T3`. The correct query should be:\n\n```sql\nSELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN T3.event_name = 'Yearly Kickoff' THEN T1.cost ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / SUM(T1.cost) \nFROM expense AS T1 \nINNER JOIN budget AS T2 ON T1.link_to_budget = T2.budget_id \nINNER JOIN event AS T3 ON T2.link_to_event = T3.event_id\n```",

This can be achieved by ordering the `drivers` table by `dob` in descending order (newest first) and limiting the result to 1.\n\n4. **Join the tables**: We need to join the `drivers` table with the `qualifying` table on the `driverId` column, and then join the result with the `races` table on the `raceId` column.\n\n5. **Select the required columns**: We need to select the `forename`, `surname`, `nationality` from the `drivers` table, and the `name` of the first race from the `races` table.\n\n6. **Order and limit the result**: Finally, we order the result by `dob` in descending order and limit it to 1 to get the youngest racer.\n\nThe resulting SQL query is:\n```sql\nSELECT T2.forename, T2.surname, T2.nationality, T4.name \nFROM drivers AS T1 \nINNER JOIN qualifying AS T2 \nON T1.driverId = T2.driverId \nINNER JOIN races AS T4 \nON T2.raceId = T4.raceId \nORDER BY T1.dob DESC \nLIMIT 1\n```\nHowever, this query may not return the correct result if a driver has participated in multiple qualifying sessions. To fix this, we need to find the earliest qualifying session for each driver, which can be achieved by using a subquery or a window function. Here's an updated query:\n```sql\nSELECT T2.forename, T2.surname, T2.nationality, T4.name \nFROM drivers AS T1 \nINNER JOIN (\n  SELECT driverId, MIN(raceId) AS first_race_id\n  FROM qualifying\n  GROUP BY driverId\n) AS T2 \nON T1.driverId = T2.driverId \nINNER JOIN races AS T4 \nON T2.first_race_id = T4.raceId \nORDER BY T1.dob DESC \nLIMIT 1\n```\nThis query first finds the earliest qualifying session for each driver, and then joins the result with the `drivers` and `races` tables to get the required information.",

This is done by joining the `hero_attribute` table with the `attribute` table, filtering for 'Strength' and the maximum attribute value, and counting the number of `hero_id` values.\n\nThe resulting SQL query is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(T1.hero_id) \nFROM hero_attribute AS T1 \nINNER JOIN attribute AS T2 \nON T1.attribute_id = T2.id \nWHERE T2.attribute_name = 'Strength' AND T1.attribute_value = (SELECT MAX(attribute_value) FROM hero_attribute AS T3 INNER JOIN attribute AS T4 ON T3.attribute_id = T4.id WHERE T4.attribute_name = 'Strength')\n```\n\nThis query efficiently answers the question by finding the maximum attribute value for strength and counting the number of heroes who have this value.",

The `foreign_data` table has a column named `multiverseid`, which matches the information we're looking for.\n\n2. **Determine the column to select**: The question asks for the language of the card. The `foreign_data` table has a column named `language`, which is the information we need to retrieve.\n\n3. **Specify the condition**: The question specifies that we need to find the language of the card with the multiverse number 149934. To do this, we need to filter the results to only include rows where the `multiverseid` column is equal to 149934.\n\n4. **Construct the query**: Based on the above steps, I constructed the SQL query as follows:\n   - `SELECT T1.language`: Select the `language` column from the table.\n   - `FROM foreign_data AS T1`: Specify the table to query, aliasing it as `T1` for convenience.\n   - `WHERE T1.multiverseid = 149934`: Filter the results to only include rows where the `multiverseid` column is equal to 149934.\n\nThe resulting SQL query is:\n```sql\nSELECT T1.language FROM foreign_data AS T1 WHERE T1.multiverseid = 149934\n```",

The `SUM` function is then used to count the number of cards that meet the conditions.\n\n4. **Calculate the proportion**: To calculate the proportion, I divided the count of cards that meet the conditions by the total count of cards with a text box (`COUNT(isTextless)`).

The `client` table provides the client's gender and birth date, the `account` table contains the account information, and the `district` table stores the district names.\n\n3. **Establish the relationships between tables**: We need to join the `client` table with the `account` table based on the `client_id` column, and then join the resulting table with the `district` table based on the `district_id` column.\n\n4. **Specify the conditions**: We need to filter the results to only include the female client born on '1976-01-29'.
