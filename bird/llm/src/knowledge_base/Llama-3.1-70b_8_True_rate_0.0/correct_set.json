The `hero_power` table serves as a bridge between superheroes and their superpowers, as it contains foreign keys referencing both `superhero` and `superpower`.\n\n3. **Establish the relationships**: To link '3-D Man' to his superpowers, we need to join the `superhero`, `hero_power`, and `superpower` tables. The joins are based on the foreign key relationships:\n   - `superhero.id` = `hero_power.hero_id`\n   - `hero_power.power_id` = `superpower.id`\n\n4. **Filter the results**: We only want the superpowers of '3-D Man', so we add a `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the `superhero_name` column.\n\n5. **Specify the desired output**: We want to retrieve the `power_name` values, which are stored in the `superpower` table.\n\nBy following these steps, we can construct the SQL query to retrieve the desired information:\n\n```sql\nSELECT T3.power_name\nFROM superhero AS T1\nINNER JOIN hero_power AS T2 ON T1.id = T2.hero_id\nINNER JOIN superpower AS T3 ON T2.power_id = T3.id\nWHERE T1.superhero_name = '3-D Man'\n```",

The `superhero` table has a foreign key `publisher_id` that references the `id` column in the `publisher` table.\n\n2. **Determine the join type**: Since we need to access columns from both tables, we need to perform a join. In this case, an INNER JOIN is suitable because we only want to consider superheroes that have a corresponding publisher.\n\n3. **Specify the join condition**: The join condition is based on the `publisher_id` column in the `superhero` table and the `id` column in the `publisher` table.\n\n4. **Use a conditional aggregation**: To count the number of superheroes published by each publisher, we can use a conditional aggregation with a CASE statement. The CASE statement checks the `publisher_name` and returns 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.\n\n5. **Calculate the difference**: Finally, we subtract the count of superheroes published by DC Comics from the count of superheroes published by Marvel Comics to get the difference.\n\nThe resulting SQL query is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    SUM(CASE WHEN T2.publisher_name = 'Marvel Comics' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) - \n    SUM(CASE WHEN T2.publisher_name = 'DC Comics' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) \nFROM superhero AS T1 \nINNER JOIN publisher AS T2 ON T1.publisher_id = T2.id\n```\n\nThis query will return the difference in the number of superheroes published by Marvel Comics and DC Comics.",

This means we need to find the number of chlorine atoms in molecules labeled as '+' (carcinogenic) and divide it by the total number of molecules labeled as '+'.\n\n2. **Determine the relevant tables**: The `atom` table contains information about individual atoms, including their element type, and the `molecule` table contains information about molecules, including their label (carcinogenic or not).\n\n3. **Join the tables**: To link atoms to their respective molecules, we need to join the `atom` table with the `molecule` table on the `molecule_id` column.\n\n4. **Filter carcinogenic molecules**: We only want to consider molecules labeled as '+' (carcinogenic), so we add a `WHERE` clause to filter the results.\n\n5. **Count chlorine atoms**: To count the number of chlorine atoms, we use a conditional expression (`IIF`) to check if the `element` column is 'cl' (chlorine). If true, it returns 1, otherwise 0. We then sum up these values to get the total count of chlorine atoms.\n\n6. **Calculate the percentage**: To calculate the percentage, we divide the count of chlorine atoms by the total number of molecules labeled as '+'. We use `CAST` to convert the result to a real number and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n\n7. **Finalize the query**: The final query is a combination of these steps, using `INNER JOIN` to link the tables, `WHERE` to filter carcinogenic molecules, `IIF` to count chlorine atoms, and `CAST` and division to calculate the percentage.",

However, the question only asks for the district, so we can focus on the `client` and `district` tables.\n\n3. **Establish the relationships between tables**: The `client` table has a foreign key `district_id` that references the `district_id` in the `district` table. This allows us to link a client to their district.\n\n4. **Specify the conditions**: We need to filter the results to only include the female client born on '1976-01-29'.
