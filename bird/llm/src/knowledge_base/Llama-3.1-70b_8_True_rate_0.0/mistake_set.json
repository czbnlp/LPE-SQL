The query only considered the first row for each customer, which might not represent the total consumption for the year.\n\nTo correct this, I joined the `customers` table with the `yearmonth` table on the `CustomerID` column. I then filtered the results to only include customers in the 'LAM' segment and dates in the year 2012. To calculate the total consumption for each customer, I used the `SUM` aggregation function and grouped the results by `CustomerID`. Finally, I sorted the results by total consumption in ascending order and limited the output to the customer with the least consumption.\n\n**Tip to Avoid Similar Mistakes:**\n\nWhen working with tables that have multiple rows per entity (e.g., customers), always consider using aggregation functions (e.g., `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`) and grouping by the relevant column(s) to ensure accurate calculations. This will help you avoid mistakes that arise from only considering a single row per entity.",
