Therefore, the relevant tables are `transactions_1k` (which records each transaction) and `gasstations` (which provides information about the gas stations, including their country).\n\n2. **Understand the Criteria**: \n   - We need to filter transactions based on gas stations in the Czech Republic. According to the hint, we represent this with the condition that `Country` in the `gasstations` table equals 'CZE'.\n   - Additionally, we need to count how many of these transactions occurred after January 1, 2012, thus necessitating a date filter (`Date > '2012-01-01'`).\n\n3. **Establish Relationships Between Tables**: The `transactions_1k` table contains a `GasStationID` that can be used to join with the `gasstations` table. The join operation is essential for filtering transactions based on the gas stations' location.\n\n4. **Construct the SQL Query**: \n   - Use `JOIN` to combine the `transactions_1k` and `gasstations` tables on the `GasStationID`.\n   - Apply the filters for the country and the transaction date.\n   - Finally, use `COUNT(*)` to tally the total number of transactions that meet these criteria.\n\nThe resulting SQL query efficiently addresses the requirements of the question by accurately counting transactions for the specified conditions.",

The `budget` table holds the category and amount data, while the `event` table contains the names of the events.\n\n3. **Establishing Joins**: To compare budgets for the two events, I needed to join the `budget` table with the `event` table.

The `CASE` statements allow me to differentiate between amounts for \"Yearly Kickoff\" and \"October Meeting\".\n\n6. **Avoiding Division by Zero**: To safely perform the division and avoid errors when the total for \"October Meeting\" may be zero, I used the `NULLIF` function to return null if the divisor is zero.\n\n7. **Final Calculation**: The final SQL statement calculates the ratio of the total budget for \"Yearly Kickoff\" to that of \"October Meeting\".\n\nBy following these steps, I was able to construct a concise and efficient SQL query that effectively retrieves the required data for the comparison.",

This is done by querying the `Player` table where the `player_name` matches \"Ahmed Samir Farag\".\n\n3. **Aggregate the Data**: Once I have the `player_api_id`, I can focus on the `Player_Attributes` table. Since I am interested in the long shots made by this player, I need to aggregate this data.\n\n4. **Calculate the Average**: The average number of long shots can be calculated using the SQL `AVG()` function combined with a `SUM()` and `COUNT()` approach:\n   - `SUM(long_shots)` gives the total number of long shots.\n   - `COUNT(player_fifa_api_id)` provides the total number of instances (games or records) for which stats are available for this player.\n\n5. **Final SQL Query**: The final SQL query incorporates both the retrieval of the player's `player_api_id` and the calculation of the average long shots:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT AVG(long_shots) \n   FROM Player_Attributes \n   WHERE player_api_id = (SELECT player_api_id FROM Player WHERE player_name = 'Ahmed Samir Farag');\n   ```\n\nThis query effectively combines subqueries and aggregate functions to arrive at the desired average long-shot statistic for the player in question.",

Therefore, both tables are needed to retrieve the required information.\n\n2. **Determine the Relationship**: The `superhero` table has a foreign key `publisher_id` that links to the `id` of the `publisher` table. This implies a join between these two tables is necessary to access both superhero names and their corresponding publisher names.\n\n3. **Define the Selection Condition**: The query needs to find the publishers specifically for three superheroes: 'Hawkman', 'Karate Kid', and 'Speedy'. This indicates the use of a `WHERE` clause to filter superheroes based on their names.\n\n4. **Construct the JOIN**: Using a `JOIN` clause allows us to combine rows from the `superhero` and `publisher` tables where the `publisher_id` in the `superhero` table matches the `id` in the `publisher` table.\n\n5. **Formulate the SQL Query**: Combining all these elements results in the following SQL statement:\n   - Select the `publisher_name` from the `publisher` table.\n   - Join it with the `superhero` table using the `publisher_id`.\n   - Filter the superhero names using an `IN` clause to include only 'Hawkman', 'Karate Kid', and 'Speedy'.\n\nThus, the final SQL query effectively retrieves the desired publisher names for the specified superheroes while maintaining clarity and efficiency.",

To count only those with blue eyes, I applied a `FILTER` condition: `WHERE eye_colour.colour = 'Blue'`.\n\n4. **Calculating the Percentage**: \n   - The percentage is calculated by taking the count of superheroes with blue eyes divided by the total superhero count, multiplied by 100.

Similarly, I calculated the count for female superheroes.\n\n3. **Division for Ratio**: To obtain the desired ratio, I divided the count of male superheroes by the count of female superheroes.

This requires filtering the `comments` table by the `PostId` of the post returned from the subquery. I used `COUNT(*)` to get the total number of comments:\n     ```sql\n     SELECT COUNT(*) FROM comments WHERE PostId = (subquery);\n     ```\n\n4. **Combine Steps into Final SQL Statement**:\n   - Integrating both parts, the final query counts the comments for the highest scoring post:\n     ```sql\n     SELECT COUNT(*) FROM comments WHERE PostId = (SELECT Id FROM posts ORDER BY Score DESC LIMIT 1);\n     ```\n\nThis logical flow ensures that the query correctly targets the relationship between posts and comments, focusing only on the relevant post with the highest score.",

This forms the first part of our `WHERE` clause.\n\n3. **Count Running Contracts**: To find the number of loans still running, we need to count records where `status = 'C'`.
