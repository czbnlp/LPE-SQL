This function returns `NULL` if the second argument (the CZK count) is zero, preventing division by zero and resulting instead in a NULL ratio if there are no CZK customers.\n\n6. **Final Selection**: I selected the calculated ratio as the result of the query, naming it `ratio` for clarity.\n\nThe final SQL efficiently captures the required calculation while ensuring robustness against possible issues such as division by zero.",

Thus, this is the column we need to sum up.\n\n3. **Apply a Condition**: The query requires the total for a specific expense type, which is \"Pizza\". Therefore, it\u2019s crucial to filter the results using the `WHERE` clause to include only those rows where `expense_description` equals 'Pizza'.\n\n4. **Summation of Costs**: To find the total cost, we use the SQL aggregate function `SUM()`, which will add up all the values in the `cost` column that meet our filter criteria.\n\n5. **Construct the SQL Statement**: Combining all these elements, I formed the SQL query:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT SUM(cost) FROM expense WHERE expense_description = 'Pizza'\n   ```\n   This query succinctly retrieves the total cost of all pizza-related expenses recorded in the database. \n\nOverall, the steps were about identifying the correct data table, determining which columns held the necessary information, applying the correct filters, and using appropriate SQL functions to achieve the desired result.",

This informs us how many qualifying income records exist.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Members**:\n   - We also need the total count of members who meet the size and position criteria to determine the percentage.\n\n5. **Constructing the Query**:\n   - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine `member` and `income` tables on the `link_to_member` field to link income entries to the corresponding members.\n   - Utilize aggregation functions: \n     - `SUM` with a `CASE` statement to conditionally count the entries where amount equals `50`.\n     - `COUNT` to get the total number of members meeting the criteria.\n\n6. **Percentage Calculation**:\n   - Finally, calculate the percentage by dividing the count of members who received `50` by the total member count and multiplying by `100`. Casting to `REAL` ensures that the division handles decimals correctly.\n\nThe resulting SQL query effectively calculates the desired percentage of members with a medium-sized t-shirt that received an amount of `50`.",

To accomplish this, I used `SELECT DISTINCT ID` to ensure that if a patient was tested multiple times within the specified date range, they would only appear once in the results.\n\n5. **Finalizing the SQL Query**: After determining the necessary components, the SQL query was structured to pull distinct patient IDs from the `Laboratory` table, applying the specified date range and conditions.\n\nThus, the final SQL query encapsulates all these points:\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT ID FROM Laboratory WHERE Date BETWEEN '1987-07-06' AND '1996-01-31' AND GPT > 30 AND ALB < 4;\n```",

The `Player` table contains player information, and `Player_Attributes` includes various performance statistics, such as the number of long shots.\n\n2. **Identifying the Join Condition**: Since the `Player_Attributes` table references the `Player` table through the `player_api_id`, I recognized that I need to perform a join to link player names with their respective attributes.\n\n3. **Specifying the Target Player**: I specifically needed data for Ahmed Samir Farag. Therefore, I filtered the results to only include entries where the `player_name` matches 'Ahmed Samir Farag'.\n\n4. **Calculating the Average**: To compute the average number of long shots, I utilized the `AVG` function on the `long_shots` column from the `Player_Attributes` table. The SQL standard for computing averages appropriately handles the division by the count of entries.\n\n5. **Writing the Query**: Combining all these insights, I structured the SQL query as follows:\n   - Select the average (`AVG`) of `long_shots` from `Player_Attributes` (aliased as T1).\n   - Use an `INNER JOIN` to match `Player_Attributes` with `Player` (aliased as T2) based on `player_api_id`.\n   - Filter for 'Ahmed Samir Farag' using the `WHERE` clause.\n\nThis approach effectively retrieves the desired average number of long shots for the specified player.

In this case, we want players with an overall rating of 77 on June 23, 2016.\n\n2. **Table Selection**: The `Player_Attributes` table contains the necessary attributes including `overall_rating`, `date`, and `player_api_id`, which links to player details. The `Player` table contains the player names and birthdays.\n\n3. **Choosing the Right Conditions**: \n   - The condition for overall rating involves checking that `overall_rating = 77`.\n   - The date condition requires filtering records where `date` starts with '2016-06-23'. The wildcard '%' allows for any time specification on that date.\n\n4. **Joining Tables**: To get the player\u2019s name and birthday, an inner join between `Player_Attributes` (aliased as T1) and `Player` (aliased as T2) is necessary using the `player_api_id`, which serves as a foreign key in `Player_Attributes`.\n\n5. **Sorting to Find the Oldest**: Since we need to find the oldest player from the filtered list, we sort the results by `birthday` in ascending order. A smaller birthday value indicates an older player.\n\n6. **Limiting Results**: Finally, to retrieve only the oldest player, we use `LIMIT 1` to get just one result after sorting.\n\nThe complete query effectively encapsulates all these requirements and logic to achieve the desired result: identifying the oldest player with a rating of 77 on that specific date.",

The eye color is linked through the `eye_colour_id` foreign key in `superhero` referencing the `id` in `colour`.\n\n3. **Join Tables**: To access the eye color descriptions while querying the superheroes, a join between `superhero` and `colour` tables is necessary. This allows us to match each superhero with their corresponding eye color.\n\n4. **Count and Sum Calculations**:\n   - **SUM**: Create a condition that checks if the eye color is 'Blue'. Using a `CASE` statement, we can increment a count each time the condition is met.\n   - **COUNT**: We need the total number of superheroes in order to compute the percentage.\n\n5. **Calculate Percentage**: The formula involves dividing the sum (number of superheroes with blue eyes) by the total count of superheroes and multiplying by 100.0 to convert it into a percentage.\n\n6. **Casting for Precision**: The result may need to be explicitly cast to a `REAL` type for accurate decimal division, avoiding integer division issues.\n\nThis reasoning led to the final SQL query, which effectively calculates the desired percentage of superheroes with blue eyes.",

The `posts` table provides information about the view counts, while the `comments` table contains the comments and their associated scores.\n\n2. **Filtering Posts by View Count**: The task specified that I only needed posts with a view count between 100 and 150.

AS REAL)` to ensure that the division returns a real number, which is vital for an accurate percentage calculation.\n\nPutting all of these considerations together, the final query succinctly captures the desired calculation while adhering to SQL syntax standards. Here's the SQL generated:\n```sql\nSELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN T1.convertedManaCost = 7 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(*) \nFROM cards AS T1 \nINNER JOIN sets AS T2 ON T1.setCode = T2.code \nWHERE T2.name = 'Coldsnap'\n```",

This sorts the results in descending order based on the count of schools.\n\n6. **Limit Results**: Finally, I only need the county with the highest count, so I apply `LIMIT 1` to ensure the query returns just one result\u2014the county with the most schools without physical buildings.\n\nCombining all these considerations, the resulting SQL query effectively filters the relevant schools based on the specified conditions and aggregates the counts by county, which directly addresses the question posed.",

The gender of the clients is stored in the `gender` column.\n\n3. **Filtering for Female Clients**: To focus on females, I identified that I need to filter the `client` table by the condition `gender = 'F'`.\n\n4. **Finding Relevant District IDs**: I needed the `district_id` from the `client` table to correlate clients with their respective districts. Therefore, I wrote a subquery to select the `district_id` from `client` where the gender is female.\n\n5. **Counting Districts with Criteria**: In the main query, I wanted to count distinct districts from the `district` table where the criteria for average salary (A11) is met.
