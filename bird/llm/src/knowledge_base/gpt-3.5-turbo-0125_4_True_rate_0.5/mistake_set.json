Your revised query included filtering for `CustomerID IN (SELECT CustomerID FROM customers WHERE Segment = 'LAM')`, which effectively narrows down the customer set before grouping and ordering by consumption.\n\nThe ground truth SQL query is more efficient, using an `INNER JOIN` to directly connect the `customers` and `yearmonth` tables. This ensures that only relevant customers in the `LAM` segment are considered when aggregating consumption data.\n\n**Tip to Avoid Similar Mistakes:**\nAlways ensure to join relevant tables based on your filters to maintain data integrity and relevance, particularly in cases where segment filtering impacts the aggregation of results.

Although comparing the date directly works in many cases, in this specific context, using `SUBSTR` on the date column ensures we are consistently comparing only the date part, aligned with the desired format. Thus, the corrected approach precisely extracts the substring to compare.\n\n### Tip to Avoid Future Mistakes\nAlways ensure that date comparisons in SQL queries are done in the format you expect. When working with date columns that are stored as text, using functions like `SUBSTR` can help align the comparisons correctly.
