        "thought process": "To generate the SQL query for calculating the percentage of superheroes published by Marvel Comics with a height between 150 cm and 180 cm, I followed these key reasoning steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Tables**: The `superhero` and `publisher` tables are crucial since we need superhero details (including height) and their corresponding publishers.\n\n2. **Define the Height Condition**: The criteria specify that only superheroes with a height between 150 cm and 180 cm should be considered. This translates to a `WHERE` clause using the `height_cm` field.\n\n3. **Join Tables**: Since the superhero's publisher is identified by a foreign key in the `superhero` table pointing to the `publisher` table, an `INNER JOIN` is used to combine these two tables based on the `publisher_id`.\n\n4. **Calculate Marvel Heroes**: To find how many superheroes are published by Marvel Comics, I used a `CASE` statement within a `SUM` function. This counts each instance where the publisher's name is 'Marvel Comics'.\n\n5. **Calculate Total Superheroes**: For the total number of superheroes in the specified height range, I used `COUNT(*)`, which counts all records meeting the height criteria.\n\n6. **Percentage Calculation**: Finally, the percentage is calculated by dividing the count of Marvel superheroes by the total count of superheroes in that height range, and multiplying by 100 to express it as a percentage.\n\n7. **Casting for Accuracy**: To ensure accurate division (preventing integer division), I cast the sum to `REAL` before performing the division.\n\nThis approach combines filtering, aggregation, and calculation systematically to derive the required percentage.

The `superhero` table contains both the superhero names and their weights, while the `gender` table links to the `superhero` table via `gender_id`.\n\n3. **Calculate Average Weight**: To find 79% of the average weight of all superheroes, I recognized the need to use an aggregate function (`AVG`) and multiply the result by 0.79. This requires a subquery that calculates this average.\n\n4. **Filter by Gender**: I needed to ensure the superheroes selected were male. I accomplished this by using a subquery in the `WHERE` clause to match the `gender_id` of superheroes with the `id` of males from the `gender` table.\n\n5. **Combine Conditions**: I constructed the `WHERE` clause to check both conditions: gender (`gender_id` for 'Male') and weight (greater than calculated average weight). \n\n6. **Select the Desired Output**: Finally, I specified that the output should only include `superhero_name`, which directly aligns with the requirements of the query.\n\nBy applying these steps in a logical sequence, I built a SQL query that effectively retrieves the desired superhero names based on the specified conditions.",

This means we need to aggregate the posts by `OwnerUserId` and filter the groups that have a count greater than 10.\n\n2. **Subquery for Filtering Users**: I created a subquery that selects `OwnerUserId` from the `posts` table. This subquery groups the results by `OwnerUserId` and uses `HAVING COUNT(*) > 10` to ensure we only retrieve users who have more than 10 posts.\n\n3. **Join Users and Subquery**: Next, I needed to connect this subquery back to the `users` table to get the associated user data, specifically their up votes and age. I used a `JOIN` to match `Id` from `users` to `OwnerUserId` from the subquery.\n\n4. **Calculate Averages**: After setting up the join, I selected the average of `UpVotes` and `Age` from the `users` table. The SQL functions `AVG()` handle the average calculation directly for both fields.\n\n5. **Final Selection**: The outer query retrieves the two average values of interest, resulting in the required aggregate information.\n\nBy structuring the query this way, I ensured I was efficiently filtering and joining the necessary data to produce the requested averages while adhering to the constraints provided in the problem statement.",

Since we need data specific to the years 2010 and 2011, this column is key.\n\n2. **Aggregate Function Requirements**: We want two separate counts:\n   - The total number of votes in 2010.\n   - The total number of votes in 2011.\n   Using the `COUNT` function allows us to count the relevant records effectively.\n\n3. **Conditional Counting**: To differentiate between the two years for counting, I used case statements inside the `COUNT` function. This way, we can count votes conditionally based on the year extracted from the `CreationDate`.\n\n4. **Year Extraction**: The `strftime('%Y', CreationDate)` function is used to extract the year from the `CreationDate` string. This method provides an efficient way to filter votes based on their respective years.\n\n5. **Division for Ratio**: To find the ratio of votes for the two years, the count of votes from 2010 is cast as a real number (to allow for decimal results) and divided by the count of votes from 2011.\n\n6. **SQL Statement Construction**: The final SQL query combines these components in a clear and concise manner, ensuring it counts only votes from the specified years and calculates their ratio correctly.\n\nHere's the SQL query constructed from this thought process:\n```sql\nSELECT CAST(COUNT(CASE WHEN strftime('%Y', CreationDate) = '2010' THEN Id END) AS REAL) / COUNT(CASE WHEN strftime('%Y', CreationDate) = '2011' THEN Id END) AS vote_ratio \nFROM votes;\n```\n\nOverall, the approach involved using conditional logic for counting based on extracted years, followed by a division to derive the ratio, all while adhering to SQL syntax for aggregates and conditions.",

Employing a subquery with `uuid IN (...)` allows me to match the cards in the `cards` table with those that meet the legality criteria.\n\n5. **Define Legality Criteria**: In the subquery, I specified that the format must be 'commander' and the status must be 'Legal' using `WHERE` conditions.

This is done using `WHERE a.element = 'i'`.\n\n3. **Count Bonds for Each Atom**: In the `connected` table, each row represents a connection between two atoms. To find the number of unique bonds associated with each iodine atom, we need to group the results by the `atom_id` of iodine atoms and count the distinct `bond_id` values they are involved in. This is accomplished with `GROUP BY a.atom_id` and `COUNT(DISTINCT c.bond_id)`.\n\n4. **Calculate the Average**: After counting the bonds for each iodine atom, we need to compute the overall average.

        "thought process": "To generate the SQL query for calculating the average amount of loans that are still under running contracts with a specific statement issuance after each transaction, I followed these key steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Tables**: The query requires data from the `loan` table (to get loan amounts and statuses) and the `account` table (to filter based on the frequency of transactions).\n\n2. **Define the Criteria**:\n    - **Loan Status**: We need to filter loans where the `status` is either 'C' (running contract) or 'D' (running contract, client in debt).\n    - **Transaction Frequency**: We're only interested in accounts with the frequency 'POPLATEK PO OBRATU', which indicates issuance after transactions.\n\n3. **Join Tables**: To access both loan amounts and account frequency, a `JOIN` is required:\n   - An `INNER JOIN` on the `account` and `loan` tables using `account_id` allows us to combine relevant data.\n\n4. **Calculate Average**: Use the `AVG()` aggregate function on the loan amount column to compute the average for the selected records.\n\n5. **Final Query Construction**: Assemble the `SELECT` statement with the appropriate `FROM`, `JOIN`, and `WHERE` clauses to get the desired result.\n\nHere's the finalized SQL:\n```sql\nSELECT AVG(L.amount) AS average_loan_amount \nFROM loan AS L \nINNER JOIN account AS A ON L.account_id = A.account_id \nWHERE L.status IN ('C', 'D') AND A.frequency = 'POPLATEK PO OBRATU';\n```\n\nThis structured approach allows for a clear understanding of how the SQL query was built step-by-step, ensuring it retrieves the correct information based on the specified conditions.",
