Initially, I used `LIKE '1991-10%'`, which would capture any dates starting with '1991-10', but it might not align precisely with the expected format for specific days. This adjustment improves accuracy when targeting events solely within that month. \n\nAdditionally, I employed `SELECT DISTINCT P.ID` to eliminate duplicate entries from the result set, ensuring every patient is listed only once, which is critical for clarity in the output when patients may have undergone multiple tests.\n\n### Tip to Avoid Future Mistakes:\n\nAlways verify the date formatting and patterns carefully, particularly when using `LIKE`, to ensure you're capturing results accurately based on the intended time frame. Additionally, consider using `DISTINCT` when querying patient identifiers in situations where duplicates may arise due to joins with related tables. This approach ensures data integrity and clarity.",

This oversight would lead to inaccurate results because both conditions needed to be combined in an `OR` clause to cater to both sexes.\n\nBy correcting this to utilize an `OR`, the updated query accurately reflects the logic that if the patient's uric acid level is appropriate for their sex, it should return 'Normal'; otherwise, it returns 'Abnormal'. Additionally, using logical concatenation ensures all conditions are mutually exclusive and appropriate outcomes are derived based on the patient's sex.\n\n### Tip to Avoid Future Mistakes:\n\nAlways carefully evaluate the logical conditions in your `CASE` statements. Ensure to use `OR` for scenarios where either condition can apply, as separate clauses with `AND` can lead to logical silos, resulting in missed outcomes. Check your conditions systematically to ensure comprehensive coverage of all possible cases as necessary.",

The only noticeable difference was the explicit selection of ID alongside SEX, which does not alter the core logic of the grouping on SEX. \n\n### Tip to Avoid Future Mistakes:\nWhen performing complex queries, always review the grouping and selection clauses to ensure they serve the intended purpose. If the query returns the correct result without ambiguity, it may not require correction.

The query did not include `DISTINCT`, which is essential to ensure that I was only retrieving unique combinations of diagnosis and patient ID, as multiple tests or records may exist for the same patient.\n\nIn the corrected SQL, I included `DISTINCT`, which allows the query to return distinct combinations of `Diagnosis`, `ID`, and `Age`, addressing the potential for duplicate results that might arise from having multiple lab records per patient.\n\n### Tip to Avoid Future Mistakes:\nAlways consider how duplicate entries may occur when joining tables, especially with aggregate or complex data.
