This is achieved by adding a `WHERE` clause with the condition `T3.keyword_name = 'angel'`.\n\n5. **Construct the SQL query**: By combining the above steps, we can write the SQL query:\n   ```sql\nSELECT T1.title \nFROM movie AS T1 \nINNER JOIN movie_keywords AS T2 ON T1.movie_id = T2.movie_id \nINNER JOIN keyword AS T3 ON T2.keyword_id = T3.keyword_id \nWHERE T3.keyword_name = 'angel'\n```\n\nThis query effectively retrieves the movie titles associated with the keyword \"angel\" by navigating the relationships between the `movie`, `movie_keywords`, and `keyword` tables.",

The `Employee` table contains information about employees, and the `Shift` table contains information about shifts.\n\n2. **Determine the join condition**: We need to join the `Employee` table with the `Shift` table based on the `ShiftID` column, which is common to both tables.\n\n3. **Specify the filter conditions**: We need to filter employees who started working in 2009 or later, which can be done by adding a condition to the `WHERE` clause: `HireDate >= '2009-01-01'`. We also need to identify night shifts, but since the problem doesn't specify how to identify night shifts, we'll assume that we can identify them based on the `StartTime` and `EndTime` columns in the `Shift` table. However, since the query doesn't actually filter for night shifts, we'll assume that the problem is only asking for employees who started in 2009 or later, regardless of their shift.\n\n4. **Specify the aggregation function**: We need to count the number of employees who meet the filter conditions, which can be done using the `COUNT` aggregation function.\n\n5. **Write the SQL query**: Based on the above steps, the SQL query would be:\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(T1.BusinessEntityID) \nFROM Employee AS T1 \nINNER JOIN Shift AS T2 ON T1.ShiftID = T2.ShiftID \nWHERE T1.HireDate >= '2009-01-01'\n```\nNote that this query assumes that the `HireDate` column in the `Employee` table is of a date type, and that the `>=` operator can be used to compare dates. Also, as mentioned earlier, this query does not actually filter for night shifts, so the result may not be accurate if the problem intended to ask for employees with night shifts specifically.",

The `podcasts` table is not necessary for this query.\n\n3. **Join the tables**: We join the `reviews` table with the `categories` table on the `podcast_id` column, which is common to both tables. This allows us to link each review to its corresponding category.\n\n4. **Group the data**: We group the joined data by the `category` column.

        "thought process": "### Thought Process Behind the SQL Query Generation\n\nTo answer the question, we need to identify intercity trips made during 2014 and list the city names for the start and end stations. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant table**: The `trip` table contains information about trips, including start and end stations, dates, and other relevant details.\n\n2. **Filter trips by year**: We need to filter trips that occurred in 2014. This can be achieved by using the `LIKE` operator on the `start_date` column, as the date format is not specified. The pattern `'%2014%'` will match any date that contains the string '2014'.\n\n3. **Identify intercity trips**: An intercity trip is defined as a trip where the start station is not the same as the end station. This can be expressed as `start_station_name != end_station_name`.\n\n4. **Retrieve city names for start and end stations**: Since the city names are not directly available in the `trip` table, we need to join the `trip` table with the `station` table to retrieve the city names. However, in this case, we are only interested in the city names for the start and end stations, which are already available in the `trip` table as `start_station_name` and `end_station_name`.\n\n5. **Use a self-join or subquery**: To compare the start and end stations, we can use a self-join or a subquery. In this case, a self-join is used to join the `trip` table with itself on the `id` column.\n\n6. **Select distinct city names**: Finally, we use the `SELECT DISTINCT` statement to retrieve unique combinations of start and end station city names.\n\nHowever, upon reevaluation, it's clear that the self-join is unnecessary, as we can simply filter the trips based on the conditions and select the distinct start and end station names. A revised query would be:\n\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT start_station_name, end_station_name\nFROM trip\nWHERE start_date LIKE '%2014%' AND start_station_name != end_station_name\n```\n\nThis revised query is more efficient and directly addresses the problem statement.",

I can do this using the `=` operator.\n\n4. **Construct the query**: Now that I have identified the table, columns, and filters, I can construct the SQL query. I start with the `SELECT` statement to specify the columns I want to retrieve, followed by the `FROM` statement to specify the table. Then, I add the `WHERE` clause to apply the filters.\n\nThe resulting SQL query is:\n```sql\nSELECT firstName, lastName \nFROM Master \nWHERE birthCountry != 'USA' AND birthYear = '1990'\n```\nThis query will return the first name and last name of all players in the `Master` table who are not from the USA and were born in 1990.",

I translated these conditions into SQL:\n   - `donor_city = 'Pocatello'` to filter donors from Pocatello.\n   - `is_teacher_acct = 'f'` to filter out teachers (assuming 'f' means false).\n\n3. **Combine the conditions**: I used the `AND` operator to combine the two conditions, ensuring that both conditions must be true for a row to be included in the results.\n\n4. **Specify the aggregation**: The question asks for the count of donors, so I used the `COUNT` aggregation function to count the number of rows that meet the conditions. I specified `donationid` as the column to count, as it is the primary key of the `donations` table and will always have a value.\n\n5. **Construct the query**: I combined the above elements into a single SQL query:\n   ```sql\nSELECT COUNT(donationid) \nFROM donations \nWHERE donor_city = 'Pocatello' AND is_teacher_acct = 'f'\n```\n\nThis query will return the count of donors from Pocatello who are not teachers.",

The `SUM` function then adds up these values to give the total count.\n\n4. **Calculate the difference**: To find out how many more discount gas stations the Czech Republic has compared to Slovakia, I subtracted the count of discount gas stations in Slovakia from the count in the Czech Republic.\n\n5. **Write the SQL query**: Putting it all together, I wrote the SQL query using the `SUM` aggregation function with the `IIF` conditional expression to filter and count the discount gas stations in each country, and then subtracted the counts to get the final answer.\n\nThe resulting SQL query is:\n```sql\nSELECT \n  SUM(IIF(T1.Country = 'CZE' AND T1.Segment = 'Discount', 1, 0)) - \n  SUM(IIF(T1.Country = 'SVK' AND T1.Segment = 'Discount', 1, 0))\nFROM gasstations AS T1\n```",

The `%` wildcard is used to match any time component in the date.\n   - `T1.birthday` is used to determine the age of the players, with the assumption that a larger birthday value indicates a younger person.\n\n5. **Order and limit the results**: To find the oldest player, I ordered the results by `birthday` in ascending order (i.e., the smallest birthday value corresponds to the oldest player).

We can use the `date` column in the `Match` table to filter by date, and the `name` column in the `League` table to filter by league name.\n\n5. **Construct the SQL query**: Based on the above steps, we can construct the SQL query as follows:\n   - `SELECT home_team_goal, away_team_goal`: Select the required columns.\n   - `FROM Match AS T2`: Start with the `Match` table.\n   - `INNER JOIN League AS T3 ON T3.id = T2.league_id`: Join the `Match` table with the `League` table on the `league_id` column.\n   - `WHERE T3.name = 'Belgium Jupiler League' AND T2.date LIKE '2008-09-24%'`: Filter the results to only include matches in the Belgian Jupiler League on September 24, 2008.\n\nHowever, upon reviewing the query, I realize that I made an incorrect assumption. The query I generated does not actually require a join with the `Team` table, as the `home_team_goal` and `away_team_goal` columns are already present in the `Match` table. Therefore, the corrected query would be:\n\n```sql\nSELECT home_team_goal, away_team_goal\nFROM Match AS T2\nINNER JOIN League AS T3 ON T3.id = T2.league_id\nWHERE T3.name = 'Belgium Jupiler League' AND T2.date LIKE '2008-09-24%'\n```",

Get the fastest lap number: Finally, we need to get the fastest lap number from the results table.\n\nHere is a SQL query that should answer the question:\n\n```sql\nSELECT T1.fastestLap\nFROM results AS T1\nINNER JOIN driverStandings AS T2\nON T1.driverId = T2.driverId\nWHERE T2.year = 2009\nAND T2.position = 1\nAND T1.time LIKE '%:%:%.%'\n```\n\nThis query joins the results table with the driverStandings table and filters the results to only include rows where the year is 2009, the driver is the champion (position = 1), and the time is in the format of \"hour: minutes: seconds.millionsecond\". The fastest lap number is then selected from the results table.",

This means we need to find the average value of the `fastestLapSpeed` column.\n\n2. **Determine the relevant tables**: The `fastestLapSpeed` column is located in the `results` table. However, we also need to filter the results by the `name` of the race, which is stored in the `races` table.\n\n3. **Establish the relationship between tables**: The `results` table is linked to the `races` table through the `raceId` column.

        "thought process": "Here's my thought process behind generating the SQL query:\n\n1. **Identify the required information**: We need to find the account numbers of female clients who are the oldest and have the lowest average salary.\n\n2. **Determine the relevant tables**: The required information is spread across multiple tables:\n   - `client` table for client's gender and birth date.\n   - `district` table for average salary information (A11 column).\n   - `account` table for account numbers.\n   - `disp` table to link client and account information.\n\n3. **Establish the relationships between tables**: We need to join the tables based on their common columns:\n   - `account` and `district` tables are linked through the `district_id` column.\n   - `account` and `disp` tables are linked through the `account_id` column.\n   - `disp` and `client` tables are linked through the `client_id` column.\n\n4. **Filter the data**: We need to filter the data to only include female clients:\n   - Add a `WHERE` clause to filter clients with `gender = 'F'`.\n\n5. **Sort the data**: We need to sort the data to find the oldest clients with the lowest average salary:\n   - Use the `ORDER BY` clause to sort the data by `birth_date` in ascending order (oldest clients first) and then by `A11` in ascending order (lowest average salary first).\n\n6. **Limit the results**: We only need to find one account number that meets the conditions:\n   - Add a `LIMIT 1` clause to return only one row.\n\nBy following these steps, we can generate the SQL query to find the account numbers of female clients who are the oldest and have the lowest average salary.",

        "thought process": "To generate the SQL query, I followed these key reasoning steps:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant tables**: The question involves loans and accounts, so I focused on the `loan` and `account` tables.\n\n2. **Determine the join condition**: Since the `loan` table has a foreign key `account_id` referencing the `account_id` in the `account` table, I used an INNER JOIN to link these two tables on this common column.\n\n3. **Specify the filter conditions**: The question asks for loans with a running contract, which corresponds to statuses 'C' and 'D'. I added a WHERE clause to filter for these statuses.\n\n4. **Add the frequency filter**: The question also specifies that the account should have a frequency of 'POPLATEK PO OBRATU', which means issuance after each transaction. I added another condition to the WHERE clause to filter for this frequency.\n\n5. **Calculate the average amount**: Finally, I used the AVG() function to calculate the average amount of the loans that meet the specified conditions.\n\nBy following these steps, I generated the SQL query that answers the question:\n\n```sql\nSELECT AVG(T1.amount) \nFROM loan AS T1 \nINNER JOIN account AS T2 \nON T1.account_id = T2.account_id \nWHERE T1.status IN ('C', 'D') \nAND T2.frequency = 'POPLATEK PO OBRATU'\n```",
