This implies that we need to count the number of seasons for each player and filter those with a count greater than 1.\n\n3. **Choose the appropriate SQL clause**: To count the number of seasons for each player, we can use the `GROUP BY` clause, which groups rows by one or more columns.

This involves counting the number of users who meet both conditions and dividing it by the total number of users with an average rating of at least 4.\n\n3. **Choose the SQL functions**: To count the number of users who meet both conditions, we can use a conditional expression (`IIF`) that returns 1 if the conditions are met and 0 otherwise.

However, the question actually mentions `list_update_timestamp_utc`, so I used that instead.\n\n4. **Select the correct aggregation function**: The question asks for the number of lists that meet the conditions, so I used the `COUNT` aggregation function to count the number of `list_id`s.\n\n5. **Combine the conditions with AND**: Since both conditions must be met, I combined them using the `AND` operator.\n\nThe resulting SQL query is:\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(list_id) \nFROM lists \nWHERE list_update_timestamp_utc > '2010/1/1' \n  AND list_followers > 200;\n```",

This is done using a `GROUP BY` clause.\n\n5. **Count courses**: To count the number of courses taught by each professor, we use the `COUNT` aggregation function on the `course_id` column (`COUNT(T2.course_id)`).\n\n6. **Order by count**: To get the top 3 professors that teach the most courses, we need to order the data by the count of courses in descending order (`ORDER BY COUNT(T2.course_id) DESC`).\n\n7. **Limit to top 3**: Finally, we use the `LIMIT` clause to limit the result to the top 3 professors.\n\nBy following these steps, we can generate the SQL query that answers the question.",

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant table**: The `trip` table contains information about trips, including start and end stations, dates, and other relevant details.\n\n2. **Filter trips by year**: We need to filter trips that occurred in 2014. This can be achieved by using the `LIKE` operator on the `start_date` column, as the date format is not specified. The pattern `'%2014%'` will match any date that contains the string '2014'.\n\n3. **Identify intercity trips**: An intercity trip is defined as a trip where the start station is not the same as the end station. This can be expressed as `start_station_name != end_station_name`.\n\n4. **Retrieve city names for start and end stations**: Since the city names are not directly available in the `trip` table, we need to join the `trip` table with the `station` table to retrieve the city names. However, in this case, we are only interested in the city names for the start and end stations, which are already available in the `trip` table as `start_station_name` and `end_station_name`.\n\n5. **Use a self-join or subquery**: To compare the start and end stations, we can use a self-join or a subquery. In this case, a self-join is used to join the `trip` table with itself on the `id` column.\n\n6. **Select distinct city names**: Finally, we use the `SELECT DISTINCT` statement to retrieve unique combinations of start and end station city names.\n\nHowever, upon reevaluation, it's clear that the self-join is unnecessary, as we can simply filter the trips based on the conditions and select the distinct start and end station names. A revised query would be:\n\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT start_station_name, end_station_name\nFROM trip\nWHERE start_date LIKE '%2014%' AND start_station_name != end_station_name\n```\n\nThis revised query is more efficient and directly addresses the problem statement.",

This ensures that each album is matched with its corresponding tag.\n\n4. **Apply filters**: To narrow down the results to the specific album released by Millie Jackson in 1980, I applied the following filters:\n   - `artist = 'millie jackson'` to select only albums by Millie Jackson.\n   - `releaseType = 'album'` to select only albums (not singles or other types of releases).\n   - `groupYear = 1980` to select only albums released in 1980.\n\n5. **Select the desired columns**: Finally, I specified the columns to be retrieved: `groupName` (the album title) and `tag` (the associated tag).\n\nBy following these steps, I generated the SQL query that retrieves the desired information from the database.",

Specifically, we count the `OrderNumber` column, as it represents individual orders.\n\n4. **Construct the SQL query**: Combining the above steps, the SQL query becomes:\n   ```sql\nSELECT COUNT(OrderNumber) \nFROM `Sales Orders` \nWHERE `Order Quantity` > 5\n```\nThis query counts the number of orders (identified by `OrderNumber`) in the `Sales Orders` table where the `Order Quantity` is greater than 5.",

However, since the year is an integer, it's more efficient to use `user_yelping_since_year BETWEEN '2010' AND '2012'`.

The subquery `(SELECT totalprice FROM orders)` will return all `totalprice` values, not just the maximum one. To fix this, we need to modify the subquery to `(SELECT MAX(totalprice) FROM orders)`.\n\nAdditionally, the `IN` operator is not necessary here, as we're only interested in the single order with the highest total price. We can use `=` instead.\n\nHere's the corrected SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT c_name \nFROM customer \nWHERE c_custkey = (SELECT o_custkey \n                   FROM orders \n                   ORDER BY o_totalprice DESC \n                   LIMIT 1);\n```\n\nThis query first finds the `o_custkey` of the order with the highest `o_totalprice` by ordering the `orders` table in descending order by `o_totalprice` and limiting the result to 1 row. It then uses this `o_custkey` to retrieve the corresponding `c_name` from the `customer` table.",

This requires data from the `Toss_Decision` and `Match` tables.\n\n2. **Determine the join condition**: To link the `Toss_Decision` table with the `Match` table, I used the `Toss_Id` column, which is common to both tables. The join condition is `T1.Toss_Id = T2.Toss_Decide`.\n\n3. **Filter the data by date range**: To restrict the data to matches played between 2010 and 2016, I added a `WHERE` clause with the condition `T2.Match_Date BETWEEN '2010-01-01' AND '2016-12-31'`.\n\n4. **Count the number of 'field' decisions**: To count the number of times the toss-winner decided to bowl first, I used a `CASE` statement within the `SUM` function. The `CASE` statement checks if the `Toss_Name` is 'field' and returns 1 if true, and 0 if false.\n\n5. **Calculate the percentage**: To calculate the percentage, I divided the count of 'field' decisions by the total count of toss decisions and multiplied by 100. To ensure a decimal result, I cast the sum to a `REAL` data type.\n\n6. **Finalize the query**: The complete query is a `SELECT` statement that combines the above steps to calculate the required percentage.\n\nThe resulting SQL query is:\n```sql\nSELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN T1.Toss_Name = 'field' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(T1.Toss_Id)\nFROM Toss_Decision AS T1\nINNER JOIN Match AS T2\nON T1.Toss_Id = T2.Toss_Decide\nWHERE T2.Match_Date BETWEEN '2010-01-01' AND '2016-12-31'\n```",

However, since the `BusinessEntityAddress` table is not explicitly mentioned in the query, we can assume that the `AddressTypeID` column is directly available in the `Store` table (which is not the case in the actual schema, but it seems to be an oversight in the query).\n\n4. **Specify the conditions**: We need to filter the results to only include the store \"Fun Toys and Bikes\". We can do this by adding a `WHERE` clause with the condition `T1.Name = 'Fun Toys and Bikes'`.\n\nHowever, based on the actual schema, the correct query should be:\n\n```sql\nSELECT T3.Name \nFROM Store AS T1 \nINNER JOIN BusinessEntityAddress AS T2 \nON T1.BusinessEntityID = T2.BusinessEntityID \nINNER JOIN AddressType AS T3 \nON T2.AddressTypeID = T3.AddressTypeID \nWHERE T1.Name = 'Fun Toys and Bikes'\n```\n\nThis query correctly joins the `Store` table with the `BusinessEntityAddress` table and then with the `AddressType` table to retrieve the address type for the specified store.",

We then join the `disp` table to link the card to the client, and finally join the `client` table to filter by the client's id.\n\n4. **Specify the join conditions**: We join the tables on the following conditions:\n   - `card.disp_id = disp.disp_id`\n   - `disp.client_id = client.client_id`\n\n5. **Filter by client id**: We add a `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include the client with id 13539.\n\n6. **Select the desired column**: We select the `type` column from the `card` table, as this is the information we want to retrieve.\n\nThe resulting SQL query is:\n```sql\nSELECT T1.type \nFROM card AS T1 \nINNER JOIN disp AS T2 ON T1.disp_id = T2.disp_id \nINNER JOIN client AS T3 ON T2.client_id = T3.client_id \nWHERE T3.client_id = 13539\n```",

This allows us to access both the label and element information in a single query.\n   - **Filter the results**: Use the WHERE clause to filter out molecules that contain tin (element 'sn').

This allows us to join the `connected` table with the `atom` table to get the element information.\n\n4. **Write the query**: \n   - Start with the `connected` table (`T1`) and filter the rows where `bond_id` is 'TR001_10_11'.\n   - Join the `connected` table with the `atom` table (`T2`) on the `atom_id` column.\n   - Select the distinct `element` column from the `atom` table.\n\n5. **Consider the possibility of multiple atoms connected by the bond**: Since a bond can connect two atoms, we need to consider the possibility that there are multiple atoms connected by the bond 'TR001_10_11'. To handle this, we use the `DISTINCT` keyword to select unique elements.\n\nThe resulting SQL query is:\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT T2.element \nFROM connected AS T1 \nINNER JOIN atom AS T2 \nON T1.atom_id = T2.atom_id \nWHERE T1.bond_id = 'TR001_10_11'\n```\nHowever, this query only considers one of the atoms connected by the bond. To get the elements of both atoms, we need to modify the query to also consider the `atom_id2` column in the `connected` table. We can do this by using a `UNION` operator to combine the results of two separate queries, one for each atom id column.\n\nThe modified SQL query is:\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT T2.element \nFROM connected AS T1 \nINNER JOIN atom AS T2 \nON T1.atom_id = T2.atom_id \nWHERE T1.bond_id = 'TR001_10_11'\n\nUNION\n\nSELECT DISTINCT T2.element \nFROM connected AS T1 \nINNER JOIN atom AS T2 \nON T1.atom_id2 = T2.atom_id \nWHERE T1.bond_id = 'TR001_10_11'\n```\nAlternatively, we can use a single query with `OR` operator to achieve the same result:\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT T2.element \nFROM connected AS T1 \nINNER JOIN atom AS T2 \nON T1.atom_id = T2.atom_id OR T1.atom_id2 = T2.atom_id \nWHERE T1.bond_id = 'TR001_10_11'\n```",

The `STRFTIME` function in SQLite can be used for this purpose, with the format `'%Y'` to extract the year.\n\n4. **Join with the users table (optional)**: Although not strictly necessary in this case, joining the `badges` table with the `users` table on the `UserId` column can be useful if we need to retrieve additional information about the users.

The `hero_id` column in `hero_power` references the `id` column in `superhero`, and the `power_id` column in `hero_power` references the `id` column in `superpower`.\n\n4. **Formulate the join operations**: To combine the required information, I used inner joins to link the three tables based on their relationships. The joins are:\n   - `superhero` (T1) with `hero_power` (T2) on `T1.id = T2.hero_id`\n   - `hero_power` (T2) with `superpower` (T3) on `T2.power_id = T3.id`\n\n5. **Specify the filter conditions**: To target the desired superheroes, I added two conditions to the WHERE clause:\n   - `T3.power_name = 'Super Strength'` to select only superheroes with the \"Super Strength\" power\n   - `T1.height_cm > 200` to select only superheroes with a height of over 200cm\n\n6. **Define the aggregation**: To count the number of matching superheroes, I used the COUNT() function with `T1.id` as the argument, which counts the number of rows in the result set.\n\nThe resulting SQL query is:\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(T1.id)\nFROM superhero AS T1\nINNER JOIN hero_power AS T2 ON T1.id = T2.hero_id\nINNER JOIN superpower AS T3 ON T2.power_id = T3.id\nWHERE T3.power_name = 'Super Strength' AND T1.height_cm > 200\n```",
